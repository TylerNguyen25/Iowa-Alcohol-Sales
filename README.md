# Iowa-Alcohol-Sales
Data Analysis of Alcohol Sales in Iowa pre-COVID lockdown and after.

Detailed Analysis of three large CSV files, each pertaining to a year 2016, 2018, and 2020.
* Merged and cleaned files for data analysis.
* Performed rudimentary analysis of all variables to account for missing values and type of variable.
* Used gsub function to allow for numerical analysis of quantitative variables “State Bottle Retail”, “Bottles Sold”, “Sale (Dollars)”, “Volume Sold(Liters)”, and “Volume Sold (Gallons)”.
* Created new variables by year and month using format function for more in depth analysis of alcohol sales in 2016/2018 versus 2020(the year lockdown began).
* Produced table of the most popular vendor in Iowa using members of the apply function.
* Constructed a sample size of 750 cases to create a barplot and performed statistical techniques to illustrate how the price of alcohol and volume of alcohol was impacted by the COVID 19 lockdown in March of 2020.
